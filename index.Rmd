## Bias

thought experiment: measure potholes in Boston vs Cambridge

1. everyone's rulers are off by +1 cm
2. Boston rulers left in the sun, stretched by +1 cm

***

1. bias cancels out
2. bias is correlated with comparison of interest

.fragment ...sounds simple, but still we see datasets with 100%
confounding of condition with experimental batch

## "Sequencing bias"

* this talk: bias in use of sequencing as a *quantitative* assay
* there is also bias in sequencing, e.g. calling bases A,C,G,T

## Example 1: DNA sequencing

* we are sequencing DNA for genotyping
* meanwhile, use number of reads to find copy number changes

***

## Copy number

relative to a reference genome

## Align reads to reference genome

.fragment if we assume this is a uniform process...

## Observe changes in read "depth"

## Example 2: RNA sequencing

* we want to quantify mRNA and compare across patients
* needed for research and treatment: as a marker, diagnostics

## RNA sequencing protocol

## a few sources of bias

* fragmentation and size selection
* primer ligation
* PCR

<br>

.fragment (other steps are certainly also important)
